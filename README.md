# AsyncSeleniumUITesting

NOTE: This project is fairly old and there are pobably better options now

A bare-bones solution that let's you get started on asynchronous multi-browser (Chrome, FireFox, &amp; IE) testing. Most settings are controlled via the app.config file.

## What I learned
1. Asynchronous programming in C# using Tasks and Actions (previously I'd use mainly BackgroundWorker since this was a long time ago)
2. Instantiating and running various Selenium instances, once for each browser type (Chrome, IE, Firefox)

## Previous skills I was able to practice
1. Running CMD commands from C# (used to install missing items if needed)
2. Using MsTest attributes and life cycle methods (TestInitialize, TestCleanup, etc)
3. Using Selenium and getting around the nuances of Selenium such as common timing issues
